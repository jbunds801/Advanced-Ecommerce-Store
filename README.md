# Advanced Ecommerce Store using React, TypeScript, and Redux, and Tanstack.

This project focuses on Redux Toolkit and to use actions and reducers to keep state management in one place, making it resuable across components. TypeScript was also used to ensure type saftey. Bootstrap was used as much as possible to keep the styling simple and responsive yet attractive.

-Cart has functionality to increase or decrease quantity of an item, or remove it, or clear the cart entirely.
-Cart has a simulated check out function.
-Created a carousel from the API to disply products on the homescreen.
